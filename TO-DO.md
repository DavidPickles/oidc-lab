- Proper logging (with configurable log levels in .env)
- add nonce and state
- organise docs a bit better (split off imgs?)
- take reference to process.env out of apis (instead pass in an array of name/value pairs basically all the process.env properties?)
- improve error handling, do I always want a stack trace? + Axios errors are ridiculously verbose. Maybe error detail should be a function of logging level? Or a env variable error detail?
- add cookie lab and cors lab?
