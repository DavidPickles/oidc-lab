- Enable configuration of location of server certificate and key
- Change documentation to be clear that extra ca env variable only has to be set once
- could location of extra ca be set in code?, or maybe in global config
  - global config could also be used for mapping from server certificate and key to domain names
- add cookie lab and cors lab?
