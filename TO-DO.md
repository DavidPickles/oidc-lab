- add nonce and state
- add cookie lab and cors lab?
- organise docs a bit better (split of imgs?)
- on vpn and in workspace, get axios self-signed cert error when connecting to https://demo.duendesoftware.com. But no self-signed cert error when using browser. Looks like node can't see the CA which browser can see. 
  - could offer env variable which ignores signature of certificate
    - you can do this already! NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = 0 in .env. but would be better to understand and fix it properly, needs to point node to the right CA I guess
-  Needed in some cirumsstances as axios option, to avoid "Error: write EPROTO CC1B0000:error:0A000152:SSL routines:final_renegotiate:unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled:c:\ws\deps\openssl\openssl\ssl\statem\extensions.c:922:". : `httpsAgent: new https.Agent({ secureOptions: crypto.constants.SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT, })`,
- (+ another opt that I believe does the same as reject unauthorized ...)
- maybe add a 'nuke tls security' option which does the lot?
- take reference to process.env out of apis (instead pass in an array of name/value pairs basically all the process.env properties)
